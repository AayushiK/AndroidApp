This is a program I created to convert a text file of hardcoded points into a xml file we can use for our app

HOW TO USE:

1) Put the text file in the same directory
2) Run the jar file
3) Type in the full name of the text file, don't forget the extension
4) Click "Ok"
5) The program will automatically generate a file called "graphic.xml" in the same directory
